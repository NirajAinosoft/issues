Issue Description:

In the app, there are multiple pages such as:

1-Index

2-Create

3-View

On the Index page, all elements like containers, buttons, and other components are clickable and editable as expected. However, when I navigate to the Create page (Page 2), it takes a few seconds to load completely. After it finishes loading, the issue arises:
I can type in input fields, but I cannot click on or select other elements such as boxes, containers, or other interactive components.

If I manually refresh or reload the page in Chrome, it redirects back to the Index page. When I navigate to the Create page again, the same issue persists.
